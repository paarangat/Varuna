I want to create an interactive 3D scene in JavaScript using Three.js that features a realistic ship sailing on a dynamic ocean. Please generate a complete project (HTML, CSS, and JS) for Replit with the following specifications:

Scene Setup and Libraries:

Create an HTML file that includes the necessary boilerplate and a <canvas> element.

Include Three.js via a CDN.

Use any additional Three.js libraries or shaders needed for realistic water (e.g., the Water shader from Three.js examples) and model loading (e.g., GLTFLoader for ship models).

Include minimal CSS to ensure the canvas occupies the full viewport.

Three.js Scene Configuration:

Initialize a Three.js scene, a perspective camera, and a WebGL renderer.

Add appropriate lighting (for example, a directional light to simulate sunlight and an ambient light to soften shadows).

Enable OrbitControls (or a similar control scheme) for interactive rotation and zoom.

Ocean Implementation:

Use the Three.js water shader (or an equivalent) to create a realistic, animated ocean surface.

Configure the water material to mimic realistic wave movements, reflections, and refractions.

Set up parameters such as wave amplitude, speed, and distortion so that the ocean looks natural and dynamic.

Optionally, add a skybox or background gradient to enhance the scene’s realism.

Ship Model Integration:

Load a realistic ship model (preferably in glTF format) using GLTFLoader. (You may reference your images as a guide for the ship’s appearance, e.g., hull shape, deck details, and textures.)

Position the ship so that it appears to be floating on the ocean. Make sure it is correctly aligned with the water surface.

Adjust the ship’s scale, rotation, and position to match the realism of the references.

Optionally, add subtle animations to the ship (such as slight bobbing and rotation) to simulate being carried by the ocean waves.

Interactivity and Animation:

Write an animation loop that continuously updates the water’s shader (for realistic wave movement) and renders the scene.

Ensure that the ship’s bobbing motion is synchronized with the water waves.

Allow the user to interact with the scene using mouse controls (rotate, zoom, pan) so they can view the ship and ocean from different angles.
