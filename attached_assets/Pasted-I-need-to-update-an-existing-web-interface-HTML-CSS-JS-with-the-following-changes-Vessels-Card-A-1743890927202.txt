I need to update an existing web interface (HTML/CSS/JS) with the following changes:

Vessels Card Alignment

The “Vessels” card (currently listing Atlantic Carrier, Pacific Star, Northern Light, etc.) needs better alignment.

I want a flexbox or grid layout that centers or left-aligns the vessel items neatly.

Each vessel entry should have a consistent spacing between the name, vessel type, and status (e.g., “Safe,” “Monitor”).

If the list is scrollable, ensure the container is sized properly so that the scroll bar appears on the card without causing the rest of the page to shift.

Scroll Bar Customization

Change the scroll bar so it matches the overall UI style.

Use custom CSS to style ::-webkit-scrollbar, ::-webkit-scrollbar-track, and ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb.

The scroll bar should be thinner, possibly 6–8px wide, with a subtle track color and a thumb color that complements the interface.

On hover, the thumb can darken or lighten slightly.

Navigation Map Enhancements

The “Navigation Map” section should show up to 10 checkpoints.

Each checkpoint is represented by a dot (circle) on the map.

A dotted path (dashed or dotted line) connects these checkpoints in order.

Ensure that each checkpoint can be styled differently (e.g., different color or size) to indicate progress or importance.

The outline or background of the map should be styled to make the checkpoints and path more visible.

If possible, include hover tooltips or minimal info when hovering over a checkpoint (e.g., checkpoint name or ETA).

Card Layout & Styling

Update the card components to have a consistent look and feel (borders, padding, margins, font sizes).

Use a cohesive color palette that matches the rest of the interface (e.g., navy blue, gray, or a subtle gradient).

If necessary, include a small header or title area on each card to clearly label it (e.g., “Vessels,” “Navigation Map,” etc.).

Make sure the layout is responsive, so on smaller screens or narrower windows, the cards stack or shrink gracefully.
